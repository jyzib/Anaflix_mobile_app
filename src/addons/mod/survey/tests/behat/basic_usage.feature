Feature: Test basic usage of survey activity in app
  In order to participate in surveys while using the mobile app

      | Course 1 | C1        |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username |
      | student1 |
      | teacher1 |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role    |
      | student1 | C1     | student |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
    And the following "activities" exist:

  Scenario: Answer a survey & View results (ATTLS)
    Given I entered the survey activity "Test survey name" on course "Course 1" as "student1" in the app
    And I set the following fields to these values in the app:
      | 1. In evaluating what someone says, I focus on the quality of their argument, not on the person who's presenting it. | Strongly agree |
      | 2. I like playing devil's advocate - arguing the opposite of what someone is saying. | Strongly disagree |
      | 3. I like to understand where other people are 'coming from', what experiences have led them to feel the way they do. | Somewhat agree |
      | 4. The most important part of my education has been learning to understand people who are very different to me. | Somewhat disagree |
      | 5. I feel that the best way for me to achieve my own identity is to interact with a variety of other people. | Somewhat agree |
      | 6. I enjoy hearing the opinions of people who come from backgrounds different to mine - it helps me to understand how the same things can be seen in such different ways. | Somewhat agree |
      | 7. I find that I can strengthen my own position through arguing with someone who disagrees with me. | Somewhat agree |
      | 8. I am always interested in knowing why people say and believe the things they do. | Somewhat agree |
      | 9. I often find myself arguing with the authors of books that I read, trying to logically figure out why they're wrong. | Somewhat agree |
      | 10. It's important for me to remain as objective as possible when I analyze something. | Somewhat agree |
      | 11. I try to think with people instead of against them. | Somewhat agree |
      | 12. I have certain criteria I use in evaluating arguments. | Somewhat agree |
      | 13. I'm more likely to try to understand someone else's opinion than to try to evaluate it. | Somewhat agree |
      | 14. I try to point out weaknesses in other people's thinking to help them clarify their arguments. | Somewhat agree |
      | 15. I tend to put myself in other people's shoes when discussing controversial issues, to see why they think the way they do. | Somewhat agree |
      | 16. One could call my way of analysing things 'putting them on trial' because I am careful to consider all the evidence. | Somewhat agree |
      | 17. I value the use of logic and reason over the incorporation of my own concerns when solving problems. | Somewhat agree |
      | 18. I can obtain insight into opinions that differ from mine through empathy. | Somewhat agree |
      | 19. When I encounter people whose opinions seem alien to me, I make a deliberate effort to 'extend' myself into that person, to try to see how they could have those opinions. | Somewhat agree |
      | 20. I spend time figuring out what's 'wrong' with things. For example, I'll look for something in a literary interpretation that isn't argued well enough. | Somewhat agree |
